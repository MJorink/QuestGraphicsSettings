# QuestGraphicsSettings
A mod that brings some graphics settings to quest devices, aswell as some extra features.

## Current Settings (on release)
- Render Scale
- Texture Streaming Budget + Toggle
- Fog Toggle
- LOD Bias
- MSAA

## Planned if I can get it to work:
FSR, there is already a mod that is supposed to do this: https://thunderstore.io/c/bonelab/p/Elijoe/BonelabFSR
but that mod does not seem to work. (for me atleast), so I will see if I can get it to work.
