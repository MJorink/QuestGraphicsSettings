# QuestGraphicsSettings
A mod that brings some graphics settings to Quest devices.
PC is untested, last tested on Melonloader 0.6.5, BoneLab patch 6

## Current Features
- Render Scale
- Texture Streaming Budget + Toggle
- Fog Toggle

## Planned:
- FSR, there is already a mod that is supposed to do this: https://thunderstore.io/c/bonelab/p/Elijoe/BonelabFSR
but that mod does not seem to work. (for me atleast), so I will see if I can get it to work.
- LOD Bias
- MSAA
